        body: 'Sub-bases are never perfectly level, and a slab poured 10mm deeper than planned across 30 m² swallows an extra 0.3 m³. Add 5% waste for slabs on a well-prepared base and up to 10% for trench footings in uneven ground. Running out mid-pour creates a cold joint - the most expensive mistake in concreting.',

        title: 'Choosing the right slab depth',
        body: 'Common depths: 100mm for patios, paths, and shed bases; 150mm for driveways and single garages; 225mm for strip footings and slabs taking heavier loads; 300mm+ for heavy-duty or reinforced bases. When in doubt, go deeper - the extra concrete is cheap compared to a failed slab.',

      {
        title: 'Converting volume to ready-mix loads or bags',
        body: 'Ready-mix trucks typically carry 6-8 m³, with part-load fees below about 4 m³. For small jobs, bagged mix works: one 25kg bag yields roughly 0.011 m³, so 1 m³ needs about 90 bags - beyond 0.5 m³, ready-mix is nearly always cheaper and far less work.',

        title: 'Drainage falls on external slabs',
        body: 'External concrete needs a fall so water sheds away: 1-in-60 to 1-in-80 for patios and paths, 1-in-40 to 1-in-60 for driveways. A 1-in-60 fall is about 17mm per metre. Use the Falls & Gradients tab to convert between 1-in-X, percent, and degrees and get the total fall over the slab.',

        title: 'Concrete weight matters for access and barrows',
        body: 'Wet concrete weighs about 2,400 kg per cubic metre. A modest 2 m³ slab is nearly 5 tonnes of material - check whether the truck can discharge directly, or budget realistic time for barrowing. One builder barrow holds roughly 60 litres, so 1 m³ is about 17 loaded barrow runs.',

        q: 'What depth of concrete for a driveway?',
        a: '150mm is the standard for domestic driveways on a compacted sub-base, with reinforcement mesh. Use 100mm only for foot traffic (paths, patios, shed bases) and 225mm or more where vans or heavier vehicles will stand.',
