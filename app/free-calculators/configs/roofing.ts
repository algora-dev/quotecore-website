        body: 'Use a digital level or smartphone app placed on the roof surface to get a direct degree reading. Alternatively, measure 1 metre horizontally from the roof edge, then measure the vertical rise at that point. The arctangent of rise / run gives you the pitch in degrees.',

      {
        title: 'Why plan area differs from actual roof area',
        body: 'Plan area is the footprint of the building viewed from above. A pitched roof covers more surface than the flat plan because it slopes upward. The pitch factor (1 / cos(pitch)) accounts for this difference. At 25 degrees, a 100 m² plan has about 110.3 m² of actual roofing surface.',
